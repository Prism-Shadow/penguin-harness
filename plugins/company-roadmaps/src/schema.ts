/**
 * The roadmap tables of the organization's relational store, `company.db`
 * (`<root>/<projectId>/organizations/<orgId>/company.db`). The file is shared with
 * company-proposals: each plugin opens its own connection and writes only its own tables — this
 * plugin the `roadmap*` ones. It does not read the proposals' tables; it reaches proposals only
 * through ProposalCreator.
 *
 * The store guarantees the data itself — keys, types, value domains, NOT NULL — and an
 * append-only history: a draft, an approval, an event is a new row, and the triggers refuse to
 * rewrite or delete one. The process rules are in guards.ts. Tables are created at open with IF
 * NOT EXISTS; there is no migration runner: a column added later is added at open as well, when
 * the table lacks it ({@link addRoadmapModerator}).
