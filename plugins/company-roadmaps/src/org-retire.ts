/**
 * Deleting an organization, as this plugin takes part in it (the host's
 * `OrganizationModule.retirements`, contributed by index.ts's retirement node). The plugin keeps
 * per organization its `company.db` connection, opened on first use, and the lock chain its
 * writes and relay passes run on; the relay state itself is a file in the organization's
 * directory and moves to the trash with it. A retirement awaits the organization's writes in
 * flight, closes its connection and drops both; other organizations are not touched.
 *
 * Until the host has moved the directory, nothing may open the organization's store again: a new
 * connection would hold the file open (Windows refuses the move) or write into the trashed one.
 * RetiredOrgs keeps that refusal and lifts it only for a caller that read the organization as
 * existing after the retirement began — the host answers that read with null while the delete
 * runs, so an organization found then is a new one under the same id, or one whose delete failed.
 *
 * The same class lives in company-proposals: the two plugins share no code (company-proposals
 * knows nothing of roadmaps, and this plugin reaches it only through the module tree), and each
 * evolves with its own stores.
