/**
 * The roadmap notices: what a roadmap write tells employees, as built-in notify Actions, one key
 * per event (`notify.roadmap.item_approved`). A write sends its notice once its write committed,
 * through the run's `act.notify` (company-proposals' registry runs the notify Action by key, as
 * the same caller), so an organization's company workflow that contributes an `action` on the
 * key replaces the built-in one. The built-in ones (builtin-actions.ts) deliver what the service
 * delivered before notices existed: a line on a desk, `notify_failed` recorded when it could not
 * be; or, for the approval request and the reopening, a line into room sessions.
 *
 *   room_joined         each opening employee's desk, and each member a change of members adds
 *                       while the room discusses: the room it is in, its room session
 *   derived             a derived roadmap's moderator's desk: its room is open, or to open one
 *   approval_requested  the moderator's room session: approve the briefs
 *   item_approved       an item's owner's desk: its proposal was created (or rewritten)
 *   base_linked         a stacked item's owner's desk: its base's proposal number
 *   reopened            every open room session: the roadmap is discussed again
 *
 * These are every line the plugin tells an employee; the room relay (relayLine) is not a notice
 * but the discussion itself, and stays with the service.
