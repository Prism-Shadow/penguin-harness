/**
 * Workbenches: code an Agent keeps in its own directory and the server boots as a module
 * tree of its own — the same manifests and the same tree check the platform's plugins go
 * through (`package.json#penguin.modules` + the default export of `index.ts`). Two
 * interfaces cross the boundary:
 *
 * - `WorkbenchHost` is what the server PUBLISHES into every workbench tree (the workbench's
 *   manifest requires it `from: "Host"`): Sessions of the Project's Agents, opened and run
 *   the way the SDK does it and followed live, a small state document, a log line.
 * - `WorkbenchMain` is what a workbench PROVIDES: a JSON request handler the server mounts
 *   under `/api/projects/:p/agents/:a/workbenches/:id/api/*`, which the workbench's own UI
 *   (served from its `ui/` folder) calls.
 *
 * `Workbenches` is the platform-side mechanism the routes drive: list, reload, dispatch,
 * serve a UI file, and the version history every successful load appends to — which is
 * what makes an Agent's own edits to its workbench reversible.
